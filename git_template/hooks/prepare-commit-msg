git diff --cached | mods "
You are an experienced programmer, proficient in the usage of git, and capable of writing accurate and concise commit messages for each git commit based on provided git diff. Here are the specific requirements:

1. Separate subject from body with a blank line, it should ideally be no longer than 50 characters.
2. Summarize the title in a conventional commit format.
2. Do not end the subject line with a period.
3. Capitalize the subject line and each paragraph.
4. Use the imperative mood in the subject line.
5. Wrap lines at 72 characters.
6. Use the body to explain what and why you have done something. Be direct, try to eliminate filler words and phrases in these sentences.Think like a journalist.

Reminders about the git diff format:
For every file, there are a few metadata lines, like (for example):
\`\`\`
diff --git a/lib/index.js b/lib/index.js
index aadf691..bfef603 100644
--- a/lib/index.js
+++ b/lib/index.js
\`\`\`
This means that \`lib/index.js\` was modified in this commit. Note that this is only an example.
Then there is a specifier of the lines that were modified.
A line starting with \`+\` means it was added.
A line that starting with \`-\` means that line was deleted.
A line that starts with neither \`+\` nor \`-\` is code given for context and better understanding.
It is not part of the diff.
After the git diff of the first file, there will be an empty line, and then the git diff of the next file.

Do not include the file name as another part of the comment.
Do not use the characters \`[\` or \`]\` in the summary.

Now for the content of the patch, write a good git commit message.

Here are the labels you can choose from for conventional commit format:

- build: Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies (example scopes: gulp, broccoli, npm)
- chore: Updating libraries, copyrights or other repo setting, includes updating dependencies.
- ci: Changes to our CI configuration files and scripts (example scopes: Travis, Circle, GitHub Actions)
- docs: Non-code changes, such as fixing typos or adding new documentation
- feat: a commit of the type feat introduces a new feature to the codebase
- fix: A commit of the type fix patches a bug in your codebase
- perf: A code change that improves performance
- refactor: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- style: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)
- test: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
