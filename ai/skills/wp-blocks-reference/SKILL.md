# WP Blocks Reference

## Overview

Use `references/blocks-reference.md` to look up core block metadata: block name, category, supports, attributes, parent/ancestor/allowed blocks, and experimental/deprecated status.

## Quick Lookup

Use search to jump to a block section, then read the block fields under that heading.

```bash
rg -n "^## " /home/bjaskulski/.codex/skills/wp-blocks-reference/references/blocks-reference.md
rg -n "^## Image" /home/bjaskulski/.codex/skills/wp-blocks-reference/references/blocks-reference.md
rg -n "\*\*Name:\*\* core/image" /home/bjaskulski/.codex/skills/wp-blocks-reference/references/blocks-reference.md
```

## Answering Guidance

- Prefer the canonical block name (e.g., `core/image`) and include category when relevant.
- For attributes/supports, copy from the block section and keep the original wording.
- For relationships, use Parent/Ancestor/Allowed Blocks fields.
- If a block is marked experimental or deprecated, call that out explicitly.
- If a block or field is missing from the reference, say it is not listed.

## Resources

- `references/blocks-reference.md`: Autogenerated core blocks reference with per-block fields (Name, Category, Supports, Attributes, and relationships).
